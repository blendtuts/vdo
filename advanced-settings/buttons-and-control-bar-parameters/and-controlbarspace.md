# &controlbarspace

**Also known as:** `&nocontrolbarspace` (to disable)

#### **Description**

Reserves dedicated space for the control bar to prevent video content from being obscured when controls appear.

#### **General Option**

This parameter ensures the control bar has its own space rather than overlaying on top of video content.

#### **Usage**

* **`&controlbarspace`** - Reserves space for control bar
* **`&nocontrolbarspace`** - Disables reserved space (overlay mode)

#### **Examples**

https://vdo.ninja/?room=roomname&nocontrolbarspace
```

#### **Visual Behavior**

**With `&controlbarspace`:**
- Video content is sized to leave room for controls

- Consistent layout whether controls are visible or hidden

**Without (or with `&nocontrolbarspace`):**
- Controls overlay on top of video
- Full video area when controls are hidden
- May obscure bottom portion when controls appear
