description: Cleaner output; not as clean as &cleanoutput
---

# \&cleanish

General Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md), [`&view`](../view-parameters/view.md), [`&scene`](../view-parameters/scene.md))

## Details

Same as [`&cleanoutput`](cleanoutput.md), except:

* It still shows the play button that allows handling gesture requirements in chrome.
* Director direct overlay messages are still visible.
* When using `&cleanish` and [`&record`](../recording-parameters/and-record.md), you'll get the record button showing, but nothing else.

and as of VDO.Ninja version 26.4,&#x20;

* You can still access the right-click menu, while you can't if using \&clean\
