# \&cleanoutput

General Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md), [`&view`](../view-parameters/view.md), [`&scene`](../view-parameters/scene.md))

## Aliases

* `&clean`

## Details

Hides many of the UI elements and pop-ups that may cause unwanted visual elements not desired in a high-stakes live stream.\
\
`&cleanish`is a slightly less strict version, which tries to better balance what is available and what isn't in this mode.\


As of VDO.Ninja version 26.4,&#x20;

* You cannot access the right-click menu when using \&clean, however you can with \&cleanish
