# Social Stream Ninja

{% endembed %}

Consolidate your live social messaging streams, including YouTube, Twitch, and more, into a single chat stream that can be docked into OBS and be used to to select featured chat messages as an overlay.

Very much like Chat Overlay Ninja, except is purely for live chat and has a focus on consolidation of chat messages, instead of just featured chat. Has many features and supported sites at this point.

## Standalone App

I'm putting out a "still-in-development preview" version of the **Social Stream Standalone App**

[**https://github.com/steveseguin/social\_stream/releases**](https://github.com/steveseguin/social_stream/releases)\
\
I've been poking at this project for the past year, and due to frequent requests for it I'm making it available as a preview-build.

I'd say 90% of the features available in the extension work in this standalone version, with the interface about 50% done.

Available as an installer for Windows x64 and macOS.
