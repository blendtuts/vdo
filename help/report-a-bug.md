# Where can I report a bug?

It is most helpful to report bugs via the official [GitHub](https://github.com/steveseguin/obsninja). We also monitor the [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VDONinja/) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/qWDshMsTar) channels, though it is easier to miss reports that occur there.
