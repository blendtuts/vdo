# Feature Requests

Please feel free to make feature requests or submit bug reports; feedback of any kind is greatly appreciated. Development is largely based on user-feedback.

The best way to track submissions is to make them feature requests and bug reports directly to the GitHub repository here: [https://github.com/steveseguin/obsninja/issues](https://github.com/steveseguin/obsninja/issues)

You can also submit bug reports or feature requests elsewhere, though they are more likely to be lost or missed:

**Developer/Maintainer**: [steve@seguin.email](mailto:steve@seguin.email)\
**Discord**: [https://discord.vdo.ninja](https://discord.vdo.ninja)\
**Reddit**: [https://www.reddit.com/r/VDONinja/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VDONinja/)
