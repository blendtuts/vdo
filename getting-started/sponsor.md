# Sponsor ‚ù§

[VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/) is a passion project and is free to use.

If you'd like to gift financially as a way of saying thank you, please visit Steve Seguin's [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/steveseguin) page. Your thoughtfulness is appreciated.

While GitHub Sponsors is the main way to gift, there is also [PayPal](https://paypal.me/steveseguin) and [buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/steveseguin). Some crypto options are also listed on the GitHub Sponsors page, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you wish to contribute financially in other ways, please contact Steve directly: [steve@seguin.email](mailto:steve@seguin.email)

If you do make a gift, be sure to let **@steve** know on Discord so he can thank you.

User feedback, bug reports, and suggestions are great ways to contribute to the project; they are highly-valued. Spreading the word of VDO.Ninja to those who may find it useful is also greatly appreciated. Community involvement, such as helping to support other users, writing user-guides, and even showcasing what you've made with VDO.Ninja is also valued.

If you'd like to grab a VDO.Ninja branded sticker or mug, there is a merch store with a 0% commission fee set. It won't financially support the project, but it's always motivating to see them randomly in a stream. [https://zero.vdo.ninja](https://zero.vdo.ninja).\
