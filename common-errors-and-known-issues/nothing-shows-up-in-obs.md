# Nothing shows up in OBS

### Common causes for no video showing up in OBS are the following:

* Check OBS hardware acceleration settings - Enable or disable "Browser Source Hardware Acceleration" in OBS advanced settings
* Run OBS as Administrator (for Windows users) - This can resolve permission-related issues affecting video capture
* Try a different network connection - Switch between WiFi and cellular, or use a VPN to bypass potential network restrictions, or disable any VPN in use
* Your stream ID changed, entered incorrectly, or other setting / parameter is incorrect
* Try using a different browser to publish with; try Firefox, Edge, Chrome, or even the [native app](../steves-helper-apps/native-mobile-app-versions.md).

### If suffering from choppy video,

* Switch to Ethernet or try to [improve your WiFI ](packet-loss.md)/ Internet connection
* Increase the [video bitrate](../advanced-settings/video-bitrate-parameters/bitrate.md), especially if[ streaming a game](../guides/how-to-screen-share-in-1080p.md)
* Ensure your computer is not overloaded, especially in [larger group rooms](nothing-shows-up-in-obs.md#performance-optimization)
* If issues only exist for guests in a room, consider using [\&meshcast](../steves-helper-apps/meshcast.io.md) or increase the [total room bitrate](../advanced-settings/video-bitrate-parameters/totalroombitrate.md)

## VDO.Ninja Troubleshooting Guide

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### Windows

* Ensure that the "Enable Browser Source Hardware Acceleration" checkbox is checked in the advanced settings.
* If you get black video when it's checked:
  * Try unchecking the Hardware Acceleration checkbox (may be choppy and use more CPU)
  * Run OBS Studio as an Administrator
  * Update OBS Studio to the newest version (fully uninstall old version first)
  * If using OBS 64-bit, try the 32-bit version instead
  * Enable Compatibility Mode for OBS (right-click OBS icon → properties)
* Ensure you have started in Administrator mode

#### macOS

* Old versions of OBS, such as OBS v24 to v26.0 do not natively support VDO.Ninja, but version 26.1.2 and newer does.
  * Use the Electron Capture app if you are using a non-compatible version of OBS. > [Get it here](https://github.com/steveseguin/electroncapture) <

#### Mobile Devices

* For Android smartphones, try using Firefox instead of Chrome if having issues
* For Samsung A-series smartphones (especially Galaxy A12), try different browsers or the native Android app
* Restart your smartphone if it suddenly stops working properly
  * Commonly when this happens the video output might be just black

### Network and Connectivity Issues

#### General Network Troubleshooting

* Run the speed test at [https://vdo.ninja/speedtest](https://vdo.ninja/speedtest) or [https://vdo.ninja/check](https://vdo.ninja/check) to verify the connection works
* Use diagnostic tools at [https://vdo.ninja/browsercheck](https://vdo.ninja/browsercheck), https://browserleaks.com/webrtc, or https://networktest.twilio.com/ to ensure WebRTC is enabled
* Check the stats while using VDO.NInja by adding `&stats` to the VDO.Ninja URL&#x20;
* If video is choppy, ensure there is no packet loss and that your computer is not overloaded

#### Firewall and Security Issues

* If in Iran, China, Russia, or other sanctioned/restricted country, WebRTC may be blocked; try using a VPN or self-host VDO.Ninja instead.
* If behind a corporate firewall, try switching to cellular network or talking to your IT department
* If using PFSense or a PiHole:
  * Try bypassing it or using a different network
  * Whitelist the IP address of the remote camera source
  * Allow webRTC-related UDP traffic to prevent frame loss
* Disable any anti-virus or other security software temporarily for testing
* Make sure you have not disabled webRTC in your browser settings
* If using Brave or other privacy focused browser, ensure the VPN isn't turned on
* Try a different browser in general, or a different computer/network

#### Connection Types

* If on cellular, try switching to a different network
* If issues persist on one network type, try another (WiFi vs. cellular)
* Try with or without a VPN, such as speedify.com, to see if it helps.
  * Speedify does offer a 1GB free usage tier I believe that's suitable for testing

### Performance Optimization

#### Hardware Issues

* Update your graphics card drivers, especially after a fresh install
* Switch the GPU used by OBS if using an NVidia GPU (via Nvidia control center)
* For laptops:
  * Check this guide: https://obsproject.com/wiki/Laptop-Troubleshooting#for-nvidia-based-laptops
  * Disable power-saving mode
  * Connect power directly to wall outlet

#### Resource Usage

* If your computer is running at high CPU/GPU load:
  * Lower browser source resolution to 1280x720 or even 640x360
  * Try using H264 codec (add `&codec=h264` to the view links)
  * Specify custom frame rate of 30 in browser source options
  * Try adding \&meshcast to your push link to use the SFU service

#### Video Codec Options

* Try different video codecs by adding parameters:
  * `&codec=h264` (often best for performance)
  * `&codec=vp9` (may help with specific devices)

### OBS-Specific Solutions

#### Hardware Acceleration

* If hardware acceleration is unchecked, check it and restart
* If it's checked but not working, try unchecking it
*   In OBS Settings → Advanced menu, try toggling "Browser source hardware acceleration"\

#### Alternative Solutions

* Download Electron Capture app instead of using OBS browser source: [https://github.com/steveseguin/electroncapture](https://github.com/steveseguin/electroncapture)
* Consider using Cloud-hosted version of OBS (Paperspace or AWS with Parsec)

#### OBS WHIP Issues

* WHIP protocol may have NAT traversal issues (not fully supported yet)
* Can't publish WHIP via OBS outside your LAN? [Download our patched OBS version](https://backup.vdo.ninja/OBS_VDO_Ninja.zip). [\[source\]](https://github.com/steveseguin/obs-studio/)
* Try alternative connection methods if WHIP fails to connect

### Additional Recommendations

* Restart all devices involved (computer, phone, router) before extended troubleshooting
* If a device was working before but suddenly isn't, try a simple restart first
* For persistent issues, consider trying an entirely different device or browser
* Consider network congestion during peak hours as a possible cause of intermittent issues
* If you're experiencing issues with PFSense, check its logs for blocked connections
* Make sure you haven't limited the frame rate in the OBS browser source to something like 30-fps
* Always update to the latest browser versions as WebRTC support improves with each update
* Try an older version of VDO.Ninja, such as [https://vdo.ninja/v27.4/](https://vdo.ninja/v27.4/)
