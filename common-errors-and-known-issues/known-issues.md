### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Video Issues

| Issue                                   | Solution                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grey video from guest in room           | Add `&scale=100`, remove bitrate limits, try different codecs (`&codec=vp9`), or ask guest to use `&quality=2` |
| Green/purple video from mobile          | Use `&scale=100` or `&scale=95` on viewer side, or change codec to `&codec=vp8`                                |
| Corrupted video in OBS with packet loss | Change codec to vp9/h264, use Electron Capture app, or issue keyframes with the rainbow button                 |
| Blank browser source in OBS             | Disable hardware acceleration or refer to the help guide                                                       |
| Video camera freeze on Android 11       | Push app to background then foreground when camera loads or changes                                            |
| Camera freezes in Chrome/Chromium v131  | Try alternative browser versions                                                                               |
| Camlink freezing when already in use    | Ensure device isn't being used elsewhere before selecting                                                      |
| USB 3.x video device issues             | Avoid USB hubs and use quality/short cables directly to computer                                               |

#### OBS Specific Issues

| Issue                                        | Solution                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Black screen after refreshing browser source | Launch OBS with: `"C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs64.exe" --enable-media-stream --disable-gpu-process-crash-limit` |
| Audio delay/Max Buffer Limit                 | Use Electron Capture app for audio instead                                                                                   |
| Audio/video desync                           | Check GPU hardware acceleration settings in Windows Display settings                                                         |
| Performance issues                           | Launch OBS in Administrator mode                                                                                             |
| Overheating on laptops                       | Use a system with active cooling for productions over 30 minutes                                                             |

#### Platform Specific Issues

**iOS/iPhone/iPad**

* iOS 12+ required (older iPads may not work)
* Safari 13 may sometimes not send audio
* May need to close all other Safari tabs to access camera
* Chrome only works on iOS 14.3+
* Try "Capture for VDO.Ninja" app from App Store
* USB audio devices often don't work with iOS WebRTC

**Android**

* Firefox has bugs in larger group rooms
* Chrome may need background/foreground toggle for camera
* USB audio often doesn't work with Chrome (use Firefox or 3.5mm TRRS adapters)

**macOS**

* Bluetooth headphones may cause audio clicking, especially on battery power
* Safari has poor noise/echo cancellation (use Chromium-based browsers)
* Check for enabled Reactions/Presenter Overlay effects during videoconferencing

**Windows**

* Check Windows Sound Properties for Voice Focus settings (Windows 11)
* Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling may cause audio sync issues
* Ensure OBS is launched in Administrator mode

#### Audio Issues

* Setting audio bitrate to 64kbps+ may cause video bitrate issues (set higher video bitrate to compensate)
* Check for misaligned or high audio sample rates in OBS
* Bluetooth headphones can cause audio clicking, especially on macOS
* USB audio devices have limited compatibility with mobile WebRTC

### Alternative Solutions

* **Electron Capture App**: Often solves issues with browser sources, audio buffer limits, and browser extension conflicts
* **Native iOS App**: "Capture for VDO.Ninja" available on App Store
* **Browser Selection**: Chromium-based browsers often have better performance than Safari or Firefox for certain use cases

### General Tips

* Click browser window before video will play (vMix, Firefox, Chrome) - not needed for OBS/Electron
* Browser extensions can cause WebRTC failures - try incognito mode
* Active cooling systems recommended for extended streaming sessions
