# Can't turn off echo-cancellation on macOS

I've had user reports that MacOS is forcing Echo cancellation on all devices except the built in mic. This was at least tested with a Scarlett Solo gen3\
\
Any "extra" device has echo cancellation forced on currently.\
\
You can try forcing it off via the URL with `&aec=0` or perhaps use a virtual audio cable.\
\
If you have added insights or solutions, please contribute them.
